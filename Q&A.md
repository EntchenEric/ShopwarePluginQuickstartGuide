*Why?*
> Simple: in my opinion, the Shopware docs are one of the worst Docs I ever seen and there are no good tutorials out there and those that are, are outdated.

*Do you work for Shopware?*
> No. I do not work for or with Shopware and I do not plan to do so in the future.

*Can I help?*
> Yes you can! If you find any spelling mistakes or simmilar, please report them to me! You can also make a Tutorial about a Topic I did not yet cover!

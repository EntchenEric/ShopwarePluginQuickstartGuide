# ShopwarePluginQuickstartGuide

Welcome to the Shopware Quickstart Guide! With this Guide I will try to help you getting started with Shopware Plugin developement!

# **THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL. I DO NOT WORK FOR OR WITH SHOPWARE. FOR AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION PLEASE VISIT THE [SHOPWARE DOCS](https://docs.shopware.com/en)**

I Created this Guide while I was learning to work with Shopware. So the techniques used may be inefficient or dumb. You will not learn how to write a perfect Shopware Plugin with this tutorial, but you will have a good overview about the things that are possible in Shopware and the things that are not.

If you have any questions, please make shure to read the [Q&A](https://github.com/kollhdxdlp/ShopwarePluginQuickstartGuide/blob/main/Q%26A.md)

>__Note__
>
> If the ways to archive something in plugins and apps are (almost) the same, you may use the tutorial for plugins when creating an app. So don't get confused if a plugin is mentioned, even if you're creating an app.
